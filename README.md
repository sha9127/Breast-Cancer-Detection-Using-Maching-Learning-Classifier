Breast Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning Classifier
------------------------------------------------------------
Breast cancer is a dangerous disease for women. If it does not identify in the early-stage then the result will be the death of the patient. It is a common cancer in women worldwide. Worldwide near about 12% of women affected by breast cancer and the number is still increasing.

The doctors do not identify each and every breast cancer patient. That’s the reason Machine Learning Engineer / Data Scientist comes into the picture because they have knowledge of maths and computational power.

Breast Cancer Detection Machine Learning End to End Project
-----------------------------------------------------------

Goal of the ML project
----------------------

We have extracted features of breast cancer patient cells and normal person cells. As a Machine learning engineer / Data Scientist has to create an ML model to classify malignant and benign tumor. To complete this ML project we are using the supervised machine learning classifier algorithm.

Save the Machine Learning model
-------------------------------
After completion of the Machine Learning project or building the ML model need to deploy in an application. To deploy the ML model need to save it first. To save the Machine Learning project we can use the pickle or joblib package.

Here, we will use pickle, Use anyone which is better for you.

We have completed the Machine learning Project successfully with 98.24% accuracy which is great for ‘Breast Cancer Detection using Machine learning’ project. Now, we are ready to deploy our ML model in the healthcare project.

Conclusion
----------
To get more accuracy, we trained all supervised classification algorithms but you can try out a few of them which are always popular. After training all algorithms, we found that Logistic Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers are given high accuracy than remain but we have chosen XGBoost.

As ML Engineer, we always retrain the deployed model after some period of time to sustain the accuracy of the model. We hope our efforts will save the life of breast cancer patients
